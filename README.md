To whom that might use this repo,

Thank you for checking out this application. It is one I have poured many hours into and I hope that you find it useful either for your commercial use or for science olympiad competition. 

The only condition I have is if you download this repo, you are to preserve the creator's name, Julian Rachman, for this work as I am the sole creator of this application. 

If you have decided to go ahead and download this application, please send me an email so that I know who is using this application and for what purpose. If you have any questions, please feel free to email them to me as well.

Warm regards,

Julian Rachman | West High School | jmrachman@gmail.com
